**Reproducible identification of chromosomal rearrangements**


Co-developed with [Dr. Kate Ostevik](https://www.kateostevik.com/), *syntR* is an R package for the reproducible identification of synteny blocks and chromosomal rearrangments via comparison of two genetic maps. syntR implements an error-aware clustering algorithm specifically designed for the highly linear structure of comparative genetic map data. syntR can be used to identify synteny blocks using any type of ordered genetic markers.
