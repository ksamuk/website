# Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the lab of Mohamed Noor at Duke University. I am broadly interested in evolutionary genomics, and work on questions related to adaptation, speciation and the evolutionary consequences of recombination. I study these processes in a variety of systems, including threespine sticklebacks and *Drosophila pseudoobscura*. I use a wide range of approaches in my research, including population genomics, experimental evolution and meta-analysis.
