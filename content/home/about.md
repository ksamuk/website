# About

I am an evolutionary geneticist and my work is focused on the interactions between natural selection, recombination, and gene flow. 
I am particularly interested in how the tension between these processes shapes the trajectory of adaptive evolution and speciation.
I enjoy approaching scientific problems from multiple angles and use a range of techniques in my research, including population genomics, experimental evolution, computer simulations, and meta-analysis. 

I also have a long-standing interest in the evolution of the brain and behavior. I am interested in exploring approaches for applying modern genomic methods to classic behavioral questions.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in Mohamed Noor's lab at Duke University.
