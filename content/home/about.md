# About

I am an evolutionary geneticist and I study how recombination shapes evolutionary processes (and, increasingly, vice versa!).

I am particularly interested in the interplay between *gene flow, natural selection, and recombination*. These forces often have complex dynamics that unfold during adaptation to a new environment or speciation.

I use a range of techniques in my research, including population genomics, experimental evolution, and computer simulations.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in Mohamed Noor's lab at Duke University.
