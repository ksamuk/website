# About

I am a Postdoctoral Associate in Mohamed Noor's lab at Duke University. I am broadly interested in evolutionary genomics, and study adaptation, speciation and the evolution of behaviour. I have studied these processes in a variety of systems, including threespine sticklebacks, social spiders and *Drosophila pseudoobscura*. I enjoy approaching problems from a  multiple angles and use a range of techniques in my research, including population genomics, experimental evolution, computer simulations and meta-analysis.
