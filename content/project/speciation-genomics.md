Speciation is the process by which reproductive isolation evolves between two lineages. What is the genetic basis of reproductive isolation? How important is natural selection in this process? I am applying a combination of genomic and traditional evolutionary tools to study these questions in a very young species: the white stickleback.

### White sticklebacks

White sticklebacks are a type of marine threespined stickleback found exclusively in Nova Scotia, Canada. They are often found alongside "common" marine threespined sticklebacks, from which they are distinguished in several ways, notably white (instead of blue) nuptial colour of males and a complete lack of parental care.
