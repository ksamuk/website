The brain has received comparatively little attention from evolutionary biologists. I am working on collecting natural historical data about variation in the brain and testing hypotheses about the evolution and genetics of brain structure using threespined sticklebacks.

Work so far has included:

1. What are the neuromorphological correlates of parental care in sticklebacks? 
2. How does the brain evolve in response to predators? (an experimental study with Diana Rennison) 
3. What is the nature of sexual dimorphism in the stickleback brain?
