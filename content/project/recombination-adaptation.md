The genetic architecture of adaptation is thought to be a result of the interplay between natural selection, gene flow and the structure of the genome. One example of this is the localization of adaptive alleles in regions of low recombination, particularly when adaptation occurs in the face of gene flow. To test this idea, my colleagues and I created a large dataset of genomic data from pairs of stickleback populations from around the world that vary in the presence of gene flow and divergent selection.
