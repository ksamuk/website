abstract = "My doctoral thesis focused on testing key predictions about the genomics of adaptation and speciation.  Using a variety of methods, I examined the genetic archtiecture of reproductive isolation in the early phases of speciation, explored the intertwining roles of ecology and sex in speciation, and tested predictions about the genomic architecture of adaptation."
